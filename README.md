Overview:

The purpose of this project is to build a webpage that has more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings which allows users to filter multiple criteria at the same time.

Results: 

This webpage is very easy to work with for new users because this has filter search area whwere users can search through different fields. This webpage has 5 different search section such as date, city, state, country and shape. Users can search from anmy of this field.

Summary: 

The drawback is that user will have to refresh the page every time they search through any above search criteria. For future, we need to add clear button in the filter search section so users don't have to refresh the page again and again. They can just click clear button. The other thing that can be done to this webpage is to add give options in the city, state and country search area, so users can just easily select from the list, that way they don't have to remember the city or state names.
